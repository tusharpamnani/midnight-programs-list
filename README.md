## Prerequisites

- [Midnight Compact compiler](https://docs.midnight.network)
- Node.js v22+
- Docker (for proof server)
- Midnight Lace Wallet (for testnet interaction)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tusharpamnani/midnight-programs-list.git
cd midnight-programs-list
```

2. Navigate to a program directory
```bash
cd compact-hello-world
```

3. Follow the program's own `README.md` for setup and deployment instructions

## Key Concepts

**Compact** is Midnight's domain-specific language for writing ZK-provable smart contracts. It distinguishes between:

- **Private state** — known only to the user, proved via ZK
- **Public ledger state** — visible on-chain to everyone

Understanding this distinction is essential before diving into any program here.
